# Simulant Assets

This repository contains the core assets required by Simulant. They are kept in a separate repository
so that they can be zipped by TravisCI. The repository is a git submodule in the main Simulant repository.

Unless otherwise stated, these files are licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

Some assets fall under other licenses (e.g. OFL) and these will be in a folder with the correct license text.

Feel free to send pull requests with suitably licensed (CC0, CC-By-4.0) game assets to include by default with Simulant.
